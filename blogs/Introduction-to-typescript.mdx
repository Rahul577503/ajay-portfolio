# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It is widely used in modern web development for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Benefits of TypeScript

- **Static Typing:** TypeScript helps catch type-related errors during development, leading to more robust code.
- **Enhanced IDE Support:** IDEs provide better auto-completion, navigation, and refactoring tools for TypeScript code.
- **Code Readability:** Type annotations improve code readability and make it easier to understand the structure of data.
- **Scalability:** TypeScript is suitable for large-scale projects, making it easier to manage and maintain codebases.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To start using TypeScript in your projects, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install typescript
# or
yarn add typescript
